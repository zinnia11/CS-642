Use this file to explain how your sploit0 works.

In this sploit, we wanted to always output "Grade = A". 
The strategy I used was to alter the return address so that the next instruction executed is 
exactly the line where the variable grade is set to "A" and thus the outputted line which uses
the grade variable will always print "A". 
The function in target0 uses a buffer of size 25 with strcpy, so I could overflow the buffer and
overwrite the return address. 
Using disassemble, I found the line I wanted to start execution at was 0x0804851b. 
Also, the variable is altered based off of %ebp, but that is stored before the return 
address and thus would be overwritten by my buffer overflow. So I also had to keep that value by 
using it in my overflow string, which was 0xbffffdf8. 
Then I began the string with just enough NOPs to slide directly to the ebp and return address.
